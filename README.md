# Apple Website Clone

This project is a replica of Apple's iPhone 14 Pro page their official website. The page features a sleek design with some pretty cool transitions and effects. The website is built using React along with TypeScript and CSS and is fully responsive, ensuring optimal performance on all devices.

The purpose of this project was to challenge myself into trying some new techniques. As a developer, when you see something cool, you usually want to see if you can recreate it!

## Note

The official Apple website changes multiple times throughout the year and the design may not match the current design as I will not be maintaining and updating this project.

This is a replica website and is not affiliated with Apple Inc. All trademarks and copyrights belong to their respective owners.

I will be adding more pages in the future.
