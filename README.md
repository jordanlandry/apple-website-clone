# Apple Website Clone

This project is a near 1:1 replica of the official Apple website, featuring all the same sections, pages, and functionality as the original. The website is built using React along with Typescript, along with CSS and is fully responsive, ensuring optimal performance on all devices.

This is a replica website and is not affiliated with Apple Inc. All trademarks and copyrights belong to their respective owners.

Not every page is available on the site, I will be adding more pages in the future.

Note for this project, I am using a state to handle routing instead of React Router. When a link is clicked, the state is updated and a different page component is displayed. This approach is being used because Github Pages uses a backend to handle routes and React Router uses the frontend. Additionally, I am using Vite with React Router and the GH-Pages package has caused me many issues. Since this is just a demo and not a professionally used website, this solution will be sufficient although not ideal.
