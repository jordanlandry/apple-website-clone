# Apple Website Clone

This project is a near 1:1 replica of the official Apple website, featuring all the same sections, pages, and functionality as the original. The website is built using React along with Typescript, along with CSS and is fully responsive, ensuring optimal performance on all devices.
Note 

## Note
The official Apple website changes multiple times throughout the year and the design may not match the current design as I will not be maintaining and updating this project.

This is a replica website and is not affiliated with Apple Inc. All trademarks and copyrights belong to their respective owners.

Not every page is available on the site, I will be adding more pages in the future.
